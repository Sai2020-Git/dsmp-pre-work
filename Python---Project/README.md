 Under this project i had learn so many functions to applied many methods.


### Learnings from the project

 I will do more practice in python

 Actually when started this project it was confused but once i started slowly & understand about functions in examples. Then i will understand the task question completely what we need output accordingly i was used right function & would get output.


### Challenges faced

 In this project had faced challnge on one of task because it was so much complex & also confused to understand what ouput will require. That was taken whole day to solve that issue & i was tried so many methods but ouput was not come. Then finally applied right method & get output.
